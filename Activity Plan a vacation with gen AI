PROMPT:
I am on paid time off tomorrow - sick leave. I am going to hospital in the morning and will go to Service NSW to apply for my learner driver license. 
To make the most out of tomorrow, what planning steps should I consider? 
I like going for a walk or even getting out of my apartment for fresh air.
I like eating chinese skewers, hong kong street food style fried rice, dumplings. But I am very tight with my money. 
I want to study prompting so I can create better depictions or expressions of my internal worlds. 
Additionally I am progressing on the Google Prompting Essentials course in hope to find better ways to make contents. 
Also, I feel getting the certificate could help with refining my linkedin account.

OUTPUT:

That sounds like a full and meaningful day ahead! Here‚Äôs a plan to help you make the most of it while balancing your health, goals, and budget:

### üè• **Morning: Hospital Visit**

  - Proof of identity documents (check https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-for-a-nsw-driver-licence to ensure you have the right ones).
  - Booking confirmation (if you made an appointment).
  - Payment method (check if they accept card/cash).

### üß† **Afternoon: Study & Creative Expression**
- **Google Prompting Essentials**:
  - Set a small goal like completing one module or taking notes on a concept you want to try.
- **Creative prompting**:

  - Use free tools like Google Docs or Notion to capture your ideas.

### ü•ü **Evening: Budget-Friendly Treat & Fresh Air**
